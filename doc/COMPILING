COMPILING

The source codes for Sort Library, SortBench and provided example source codes
are created using the Atom.io (see https://atom.io/) package language-amigaos-c
(see https://github.com/alpyre/language-amigaos-c).
This means they provide makefiles which require at least one of the cross
compiler toolchains for AmigaOS (and compatibles). The toolchains below are
tested to be working:
  For 68k OS3:     https://github.com/bebbo/amigaos-cross-toolchain
  For PPC OS4:     https://github.com/jens-maus/amigaos-cross-toolchain
  For PPC MorphOS: https://github.com/AmigaPorts/morphos-cross-toolchain (GCC6)

Source codes include and make use of SDI_headers. This means they are able to
compile for AmigaOS3, AmigaOS4 and MorphOS.
(see http://aminet.net/package/dev/c/SDI_headers.lha)

If you have installed the required toolchains on your system, to compile:
  - Open a shell terminal
  - cd to project directory
  - type make
This will compile for m68k AmigaOS3.

To compile for AmigaOS4 type:
  make OS=os4
To compile for MorphOS type:
  make OS=mos

OTHER COMPILERS

Since SDI_headers are used, the code should compile with various classic
compilers like SAS/C, VBCC etc., yet this is not tested and there are no
makefiles provided for them.
If you feel adventurous enough to experiment with other compilers, always feel
free to open issues if there are any and pull requests if you've figured them
out.

COMPILING YOUR PROGRAMS

Your programs that open sort.library should be able to access the include
directory provided in src/lib during compilation. You can either have the
contents of that directory copied into your SDK's include directories or keep a
copy of it in your project directory and use -Iinclude in your makefile.

Also you should not set -DNO_INLINE_STDARG in your makefile for OS3 and MorphOS.
Because of the way SDI_headers are designed we need inline macros to have the
Sort() function (varargs variant of the function SortA() which you will probably
be using the most).
